# **App Name**: TradeWatch AI

## Core Features:

- AI-Powered Signal Generation: Analyzes financial data (Forex and US stocks) to identify potential buy/sell signals based on technical indicators.
- Signal Formatting: Presents key details of the trading signal in a standardized format.
- Configurable Parameters: Allow the user to define a list of assets, the Discord webhook, and fine-tune the thresholds of the indicators.
- Automated Scheduling: Schedule automatic checks to find new trading signals hourly. The app prevents duplicate signals within a certain timeframe.
- AI Signal Validation: Use an AI reasoning tool that examines the historical success rate of signals generated under similar market conditions, thereby refining the confidence level of each new signal and helping the app avoid the generation of noisy trading signals.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2E5266) to convey stability and trust, essential for financial applications.
- Background color: Light gray (#D4DADF), creating a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: A muted green (#88AB8E), drawing attention to important buy signals and confirmations without overwhelming the user. Its lower saturation makes it suitable for prolonged screen viewing, as required by a trading application.
- Use a clean, sans-serif font to ensure the figures are legible.
- Minimalist line icons should be used.
- Employ a card-based layout to present individual signals or configuration options.
- Implement subtle transitions or loading animations to indicate activity and provide feedback.
